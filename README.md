## Volumetric lighting 

For my graduation project I chose the topic of volumetric lighting influencing gameplay.

I chose this topic as I wished to learn more about graphics programming. The goal is to research ways that volumetric lighting and potentially light scattering can be used to influence gameplay. 
Which makes it a task that leans into both grapics programming as well as game design. 

This research also includes finding optimization techniques for scenes with a multitude of lights.
